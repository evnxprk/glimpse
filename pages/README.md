## Guidelines
Pages in this directory SHOULD have their own descriptions and titles
to improve SEO. Do not over-clutter descriptions or titles. As a general
guideline, titles should be less than 70 characters and descriptions
should be less than 150 characters. There should be few keywords, however
those that do exist should be as close to the front as possible (esp.
for titles).
